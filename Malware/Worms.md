# Worms
---
A worm is similar [[malware]] to a virus, but unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. A worm uses the network to send copies of itself to any connected hosts. Worms can run independently and spread quickly. They do not necessarily require activation or human intervention. Self-spreading network worms can have a much greater impact than a single virus and can infect large parts of the internet quickly.

## Features:
- they spread over internet really quickly
- leveraging OS bugs of software bugs
- doesn't require user interaction
