# Trojan Horse
---
A Trojan horse is a [[malware]] that is written to appear like a legitimate program, when in fact it is an attack tool. It cannot replicate itself. A Trojan horse relies upon its legitimate appearance to deceive the victim into initiating the program. It may be relatively harmless or may contain code that can damage the hard drive content of the computer. Trojans can also create a back door into a system that then allows threat actors to gain access.

## Trojan types:
- ### RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
	- provides the attacker with remote control over a victim PC
