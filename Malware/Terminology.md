# Terminology
---
## Threat vector
Method which can be used by attacker to access victim machine (vulnerable situations) 
#### e.g. unpatched software, bad configured firewall

## Attack vector
Method how attacker get into the machine and how he infect it with [[malware]]. **This is what attacker actually did to get into the machine!** 

## [[Malware]] Infections
- software (different software)
- messaging (email)
- media (usb, cd, dvd)

## Watering Hole 
Habits developed by victims which can be exploited by attacker.
#### e.g. every day visiting same website which can became target of attacker to get data from victim.
The easiest attempt to get data from victim it will by hosting similar domain name to the one which victim often visiting. 

## Zombie
The machine under control of attacker (compromised computer)

## Botnet
Malicious bot software infects a host, usually through an email or web page link, by downloading and installing a remote control function. When infected, the “zombie” computer contacts servers managed by the botnet creator. These servers act as a command and control (C&C) center for an entire network of compromised devices, which is called a botnet. Infected machines can often pass the software to other unprotected devices in their network, increasing the size of the botnet. Some botnets include many thousands of infected devices.

Bot software programs can also cause security issues on the infected machines. This is because the installed software may include the ability to log keystrokes, gather passwords, capture and analyze packets, gather financial information, launch DoS attacks, and relay spam. Bots take advantage of time zones, often waking up the zombie systems during the idle times in each time zone. Many users keep their computers always connected to the internet, even when they are away from home or sleeping. This creates the perfect environment for botnet creators to use the bandwidth and processing power of the idle devices.

## Active intersection 
Occurs when someone is in the middle of traffic and is able to capture it or modify. 

## Privilege escalation 
Occurs when attacker exploit a system design flaw or bug to gain access to resources that should not be available to him. 

## RAT (Remote Access [[Trojan]])
Provides the attacker with remote control over a victim PC

## [[Logic Bomb]]
Malicious code inside software which will execute under certain condition. 

## Malware [[Exploit Technique]]
Describes the method how malware code infect a target system.
