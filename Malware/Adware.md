# Adware
---
Adware is a form of [[spyware]] that is used to collect information about a user based on websites the user visits. That information is then used for targeted advertising. Adware is commonly installed by a user in exchange for a "free" product. When a user opens a browser window, adware can start new browser instances which attempt to advertise products or services based on the surfing practices of a user. The unwanted browser windows can open repeatedly, and can make surfing the internet very difficult, especially with slow internet connections. Adware can be very difficult to uninstall.
