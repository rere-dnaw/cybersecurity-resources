# Popups Pop-unders
---
Popups and pop-unders are additional advertising windows that display when a website is visited. Unlike adware, popups and pop-unders are not intended to collect information about the user and are typically associated only with the website being visited.

**Popups -** These open in front of the current browser window.

**Pop-unders -** These open behind the current browser window.

They can be annoying and usually advertise products or services that are not wanted by the user.
