# nmap
---
Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security
auditing. 

---
## Examples:
#### Standard port scan 
```bash
nmap -sV -A -v <IP>
```

---
## Common flags:
#### Half open scan (stealth scan). 
```bash
-sS
```
*Nmap* sends [[TCP]] *SYN*, the server will send back *SYN*, *ACK* but then client is terminating connection by sending *RST* back to server.

A lot of systems will detect this attempt for stealth scanning as this type of packets can be easily identified by analyzing packets flow.
