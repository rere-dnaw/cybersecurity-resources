# snmpwalk

is an [[SNMP]] application that uses SNMP GETNEXT requests to query a network entity for a tree of information. An  object  identifier  (OID) may be given on the command line.  This OID specifies which portion of the object identifier space will be searched using GETNEXT requests.

## Notes:
- **SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it.**
