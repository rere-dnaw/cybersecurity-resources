John can crack a variety of different password hashes. You can see exactly which hashes he can crack by running the list formats command. This command is also helpful when trying to manually specify a hash type. If youâ€™re in an exam and have forgotten how to ask John to crack a raw MD5 hash, then this command could help.

There is a lot of *john the ripper* tools which can be found with following command:
```bash
ls /usr/bin | grep john
```

---
## Examples:
#### Try to crack `hash.txt` with password from list `passList.txt`
```bash
john --wordlist=~/SecList/Passwords/Common-Credentials/passList.txt hash.txt
```

#### List supported hashes
```bash
sudo john --list=formats
```
