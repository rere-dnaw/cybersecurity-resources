# nmap
---
Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security
auditing. 

### Port state:
**OPEN** 
**FILTERED** - can happens when firewall allows connections from specific port
**CLOSE**

---
## Examples:
#### Standard port scan 
```bash
nmap -sV -A -v <IP>
```

#### Running **nmap** with custom script:
```bash
nmap --script <script_name> -p <port> <IP>
```

---
## Common flags:
#### Enable OS detection
```bash
-A
```
#### Run scripts to gather more detailed info about service
```bash
-sC
```
#### Perform a version scan
```bash
-sV
```
#### Scan all ports
```bash
-p-
```

#### Half open scan (stealth scan). 
```bash
-sS
```
*Nmap* sends [[TCP]] *SYN*, the server will send back *SYN*, *ACK* but then client is terminating connection by sending *RST* back to server.

A lot of systems will detect this attempt for stealth scanning as this type of packets can be easily identified by analyzing packets flow.
