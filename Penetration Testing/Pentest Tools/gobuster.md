# gobuster
---
Written in the Go language, this tool enumerates hidden files along with the remote directories.

**Gobuster is an aggressive scan. It's noisy and is noticed. Only use against systems you have permissions to scan against.**

---
## Examples:
#### scanning for directories
```bash
gobuster dir -u <URL or IP> -w /wordlists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

#### scanning for subdomain
```bash
gobuster dns -d <URL or IP> -w /wordlists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains.txt
```

---
## Common flags:
#### Look for selected file types 
```bash
-x php,txt  
```

#### Result to file
```bash
-o results.txt
```
